# scissors-paper-rock

UPDATE

I have now managed to add a decent GUI to the project. This required me to rework large sections of code as well as adding new sections. Trying to get the hang of DOM
manipulation best i can. Also brushed up on a bit of CSS.

INITIAL

This is my first JavaScript project.
So far the game plays entirely on the console.
I have gotten practice making functions and making them all work together to abstract large parts of the code away.
So far so good
